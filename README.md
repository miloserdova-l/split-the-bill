# split-the-bill


  What is it?
  -----------
  
  The application is splitting of group bills.
  
  Don't understand what it is about?
  
  
  Suppose you and your friends suddenly went on a trip to St. Petersburg. 
  
  You got to the city in your car, so of course, you paid for gas. At stop your friend Lily bought delicious cakes for the whole company. While you were driving, your friend Jack carefully selected a rental apartment for you. He found and paid for a wonderful inexpensive apartment in the city center overlooking the waterfront. 
  
  Upon reaching the city, you realized that you hadn't thought at all that you couldn't survive without an umbrella in St. Petersburg. William (the only person who wasn't afraid of the rain) went in search of several raincoats and umbrellas. And all the rest, meanwhile, ordered pizza. 
  
  Now no one is hungry, everyone has umbrellas, which means it's time to go explore the city. And when you have already visited the Hermitage, the Kazan and St. Isaac's Cathedrals you thought: "This is good, but is it possible to visit St. Petersburg and don't go to the 'пышечная' one?" The rain stopped and you joyful went to try the puffs. You found an 'пышечная', but there was only cash payment. Luckily at least one of you (Daniel) had cash.
  
  
  ..I can describe for a long time how wonderful you spent the weekend, but here is the question. It’s not clear who owes how much money to whom. And is it possible to make as few transfers of money as possible and don't forget about any joint bill? This is exactly what my application is trying to do - **calculating who owes what.**

  How to build it?
